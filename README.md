<h1>hello!</h1>
this is a place where I do stuff

I mostly make games, but sometimes I make an interesting website here and there

<h2>Yet Another 2d Platformer</h2>
the game I am actively working on (when I'm not working on things like this .md)

made as a sequal in gameplay to demo 0.4


(SEPTEMBER UPDATE) there is now a grappling hook in the game, the gameplay has updated

<h2>Yet Another Collectathon</h2>
This is the first javascript game I've made

very simple, very bad

<h2>demo 0.4</h2>
this was the first game I've made, it was never finished... hence the title

the code got terrible to expand, so I stopped
