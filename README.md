<h1>hello!</h1>
this is a place where I do stuff

I mostly make games, but sometimes I make an interesting website here and there. 
the easiest way to contact me is through [discord](discord.loglot.xyz) as i am more likely to see and reply there

<h2>Yet Another 2d Platformer</h2>
the game I am actively working on (when I'm not working on things like this .md)

made as a sequal in gameplay to demo 0.4


(SEPTEMBER 2023) there is now a grappling hook in the game, the gameplay has updated

(AUGEST 2024) there are 6 total powers, though only 3 have spots in the map, and the map has insane branching now

(OCTOBER 2024) Due to programming mistakes from early in development, i am re-making YA2P
